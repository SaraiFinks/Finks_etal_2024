The contribution of plasmids to trait diversity in a soil bacterium

Plasmids are often associated with pathogens and antibiotic resistance, and their potential for conferring other types of traits is often overlooked. To investigate the role that plasmid traits might play in soil bacterial communities, we identified plasmids carried by isolates of Curtobacterium from different ecotypes and a variety of environments. Plasmids were common, but not ubiquitous, in the genus and varied greatly in their size and genetic diversity. There was no evidence of phylogenetic conservation among Curtobacterium plasmids, even for closely-related bacterial strains within the same ecotype, indicating that horizontal transmission of plasmids is common. The plasmids carried a wide diversity of functional traits that were not a random subset of the host chromosome. Further, the composition of these plasmid traits was associated with the environmental context of the host bacterium. Together, the results indicate that plasmids contribute substantially to the microdiversity of a soil bacterium and that this diversity may play a role in local adaption to the environment. The R scripts and Anvi'o functions used in the analyses of this study are included in this repository. Curtobacterium genome sequencing data and assemblies can be retrieved from NCBI SRA and Genome databases under BioProject ID PRJNA391502.
